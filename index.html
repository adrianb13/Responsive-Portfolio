                My name is Adrian Briones. Here's a little introduction to my history. I am originally from West Covina, CA where I graduated from Bishop Amat High School. I then attended the University of California, Irvine where I achieved a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science. I now live in San Diego near Lake Murray. Prior to living in San Diego I was living and working in Orange County as an Insurance Agent with AAA. I have recently relocated and am now working towards a new career. Part of that transition is being a Full Stack Developer in training at the University of California, San Diego Coding Bootcamp.

                Now for the fun stuff on my spare time! I love to travel and am a complete adrenaline junkie. I like to try new things and learn new skills. I have swam with the sharks in Hawaii (I mean real sharks in ocean, not in a tank). I have skydived multiple times and have even done some certified solo dives. I have traveled different parts of the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and Asia. I can speak some Spanish and Tagalog in addition to my obvious English speaking. Eating different foods is almost as fun as traveling. Everything from sushi, to Korean BBQ, to pho, to a Cajun seafood bake/boil, to some great ol' American BBQ (Texas style or otherwise). So when I'm not behind a computer, I'm enjoying life!
