                    My name is Adrian Briones. I am a Full Stack Web Developer with certification from the University of California, San Diego. Here's a little introduction to my history. I am originally from West Covina, CA where I graduated from Bishop Amat High School in the Top 5% of my class. I then attended the University of California, Irvine where I achieved a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science. I now live in San Diego near Lake Murray. Prior to living in San Diego I was living and working in Orange County as an Insurance Agent with AAA. I am now working towards a career as a Web/Software Developer. I have been successful in past careers and this one will not be different.

                    Now for the fun stuff on my spare time! I love to travel and am a complete adrenaline junkie. I like to try new things and learn new skills. I have swam with the sharks in Hawaii (I mean real sharks in ocean, not in a tank). I have skydived multiple times and have even done some certified solo dives. I have traveled different parts of the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and Asia. I can also speak some Spanish and Tagalog. Eating different foods is almost as fun as traveling. Everything from sushi, to Korean BBQ, to pho, to a Cajun seafood bake/boil, to some great ol' American BBQ (Texas style or otherwise).  When I'm not betterring myself in my craft, coding, I'm walking 'til my legs fall off taking in the sights or sitting down stuffing my face with tastiest food of the town. So when I'm not behind a computer, I'm enjoying what life has to offer away from the digital world!
